What is ripple1d?
=================

:code:`ripple1d` is a Python utility that repurposes HEC-RAS models for use in
the production of Flood Inundation Maps (FIMs) and synthetic rating curves
(SRCs) to support near-real-time flood forecasting within NOAAâ€™s National Water
Model (NWM).  With the utility, HEC-RAS models can be broken up into
smaller sub models for each NWM reach within the modeled domain.  Sub models
may then be used to develop reach-scale SRCs and FIM.

ripple1d currently includes functions to:

* Export HEC-RAS model geometry and metadata from proprietary HEC formats to
  geopackages and `SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)
  <https://stacspec.org/en>`_ items;
* Associate HEC-RAS model components (e.g. cross sections, structures, etc)
  with NWM reaches;
* Create NWM reach-specific HEC-RAS models;
* Run HEC-RAS models for a range of hydraulic conditions;
* Generate reach-scale SRCs;
* Map inundation extents and depth grids; and
* Incorporate updated topographic data in mapping to reflect current site
  conditions.

Why use ripple1d?
=================

While novel methods for mapping inundation extents across broad spatial scales
are under active development, HEC-RAS models remain the industry standard, and
large collections of engineer-certified HEC-RAS models have been developed in
recent years in support of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Digital
Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) and Base Level Engineering (BLE) initiatives.
ripple1d provides utilities to leverage these large catalogs in an operational
flood forecasting setting by aligning HEC-RAS model domains with forecast
domains. Aligning model domains reduces computational overhead and allows
models to easily interface with other modules and functions of the NWM.

How ripple1d works
==================

The following steps outline a typical workflow for setting up a HEC-RAS model
for use in FIM and SRC production.

1 - Model identification and data extraction
--------------------------------------------

(relevant endpoints: :doc:`ras_to_gpkg <endpoints/ras_to_gpkg>`)

When ripple1d is presented with a HEC-RAS project folder, it scans the
directory for a complete set of HEC-RAS project files. If a valid set is found,
ripple1d then exports the spatial extents of the cross-sections, river
centerline, structures, and junctions (along with their associated metadata) to
a geopackage file.

2 - Model and NWM network conflation
------------------------------------

(relevant endpoints: :doc:`conflate_model <endpoints/conflate_model>`,
:doc:`compute_conflation_metrics <endpoints/compute_conflation_metrics>`)

The upstream and downstream limits of HEC-RAS models rarely align with those of
NWM reaches. Conflating in ripple1d is the process of associating sections of
HEC-RAS models with NWM reaches. To make this association, ripple1d selects NWM
reaches near the upstream and downstream boundaries of the HEC-RAS model and
traverses the NWM network between them, marking all reaches encounters. For
each of those NWM reaches, the utility identifies an upstream cross-section as
the HEC-RAS cross-section that intersects the reach closest to its upstream
end. It identifies a downstream cross-section as the HEC-RAS cross-section
**directly downstream** of the HEC-RAS cross-section that intersects the reach
closest to the downstream end.  All cross-sections between the upstream and
downstream cross-sections are marked as associated with the NWM reach.

As a part of the conflation process, ripple1d records a set of metrics that may
be used to assess how well the HEC-RAS model and NWM reaches agree. These
metrics are saved in a JSON file within the HEC-RAS model directory, and
definitions for each of the JSON fields are provided below.

* **Cross-sectional metrics.**  These metrics quantify the degree of alignment
  between the NWM reach centerline and the HEC-RAS model.  The metrics below
  are measured at each HEC-RAS cross-section and summary statistics are
  reported in the conflation metrics output.

  * **centerline_offset** measures the straightline distance between RAS centerline
    and NWM reach line

  * **thalweg_offset** measures the straightline distance between lowest point
    along each RAS section and NWM reach line

* **Length metrics.** These metrics assess centerline length differences between
  HEC-RAS and the NWM reaches.

  * **ras** is the distance along the RAS centerline between upstream and
    downstream cross-section

  * **network** is the distance along the NWM reach between upstream and
    downstream cross-section

  * **network_to_ras_ratio** is the network length divided by ras length

  :align: center

* **Coverage metrics.** These metrics quantify the portion of the NWM reach
  between the upstream and downstream cross-section.

  * **start** is the ratio of NWM reach length that occurs u/s of the upstream
    cross-section

  * **end** is the ratio of NWM reach length that occurs u/s of the downstream
    cross-section

3 - Sub model creation
----------------------

(relevant endpoints: :doc:`extract_submodel <endpoints/extract_submodel>`,
:doc:`create_ras_terrain <endpoints/create_ras_terrain>`)

Once NWM reaches have been associated with relevant parts of the HEC-RAS model,
a new HEC-RAS sub model specific to each NWM reach will be created.  Rippl1d
copies geometry between source HEC-RAS model and submodel so that the submodel
produces water surface elevation predictions consistent with the original
engineer-certified model.  For mapping inundation extents, however, ripple1d
downloads newer terrain to reflect existing conditions.  You can use terrain
from any virtual raster source, but by default, ripple1d will download a `1/3
arcsecond DEM from USGS
<https://data.usgs.gov/datacatalog/data/USGS:3a81321b-c153-416f-98b7-cc8e5f0e17c3>`_

As part of terrain generation, a suite of metrics are generated to quantify the agreement of the newly generated DEM terrain and the source model cross-section geometry.  Metrics are first generated for each cross-section at a set of water surface elevations ranging from the section invert to the lower of the two source model section endpoints.  All metrics (except for residual summary statistics) are aggregated to the cross-section level by averaging across all measured stages.  Another set of shape metrics as well as residual summary statistics are computed for the whole cross-section.  All cross-section metrics (except for residual summary statistics) are aggregated to the model level by averaging across all cross-sections.

**Metric Descriptions and Interpretations**

* **Residual Summary Statistics** These statistics summarize the difference between source model and DEM elevations at each cross-section vertex.  These metrics can be used to assess the magnitude of difference between the two sections, however, since they are not scaled, acceptable ranges will vary from river to river.  (Note: normalized RMSE is RMSE divided by the interquartile range and attempts to be a scaled error metric)

* **Inundation Overlap** The intersection of the wetted top widths divided by the union of the wetted top widths (closer to 1 is better).  This metric can be used to determine spatially explicit agreement of inundation.  A good example is shown in the horizontally offset example above.

* **Top-Width Agreement**  Calculated as one minus the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (sMAPE) of the source model wetted top-width and the DEM wetted top-width (closer to 1 is better).  This metric is a non-spatially explicit version of inundation overlap.  A good example is shown in the horizontally offset example above as well as the squeezed example.

* **Flow Area Overlap** The intersection of the flow areas divided by the union of the flow areas (closer to 1 is better).  This metric can be used to determine spatially explicit agreement of the cross-section area.  A good example is shown in the horizontally offset example above.

* **Flow Area Agreement**  Calculated as one minus the sMAPE of the source model flow area and the DEM flow area (closer to 1 is better).  This metric is a non-spatially explicit version of flow area overlap.  A good example is shown in the horizontally offset example above as well as the squeezed example.

* **Hydraulic Radius Agreement** Calculated as one minus the sMAPE of the source model hydraulic radius and the DEM hydarulic radius (closer to 1 is better).  This metric captures some of how well the hydarulic characteristics of the sections agree.

* **Correlation** Pearson's correlation between the source model and DEM cross-sections (closer to 1 is better).  This metric captures how well the shape of the two sections match.

* **Max Cross-Correlation** The maximum Pearson's correlation between the source model and DEM cross-sections across all horizontal shifts of the DEM section (closer to 1 is better).  This metric captures how well the shape of the two sections match, however, it is insensitive to horizontal shifts in elevations.  Compare to correlation in the horizontal shift example above.

* **Spectral Correlation** Spectral correlation between source model and DEM cross-sections, as defined by the HydroErr library (https://github.com/BYU-Hydroinformatics/HydroErr/blob/42a84f3e006044f450edc7393ed54d59f27ef35b/HydroErr/HydroErr.py#L3615).  Furthermore the metric has been transformed to range 0-1 and so that values closer to 1 are better.  This metric captures how well the shape of the two sections match.

* **Spectral Angle** Spectral angle between source model and DEM cross-sections, as defined by the HydroErr library (https://github.com/BYU-Hydroinformatics/HydroErr/blob/42a84f3e006044f450edc7393ed54d59f27ef35b/HydroErr/HydroErr.py#L3538).  Furthermore the metric has been transformed to range 0-1 and so that values closer to 1 are better.  This metric captures how well the shape of the two sections match.

* **R-Squared** Coefficient of determination between the source model and DEM elevation series (closer to 1 is better).  This metric captures how well the shape of the two sections match.

* **Thalweg Elevation Difference** Source model invert minus the DEM invert/  Values closer to 0 are better, negative values reflect a higher DEM invert, and positive values reflect a higher source model invert.  Since this metric is not scaled, acceptable ranges will vary from river to river.


4 - SRC development and FIM pre-processing
------------------------------------------

(relevant endpoints:
:doc:`create_model_run_normal_depth <endpoints/create_model_run_normal_depth>`,
:doc:`run_incremental_normal_depth <endpoints/run_incremental_normal_depth>`,
:doc:`run_known_wse <endpoints/run_known_wse>`,
:doc:`create_fim_lib <endpoints/create_fim_lib>`)

Once submodel geometry has been set up, you can run various discharges through
the model and record the results.  Ripple1d has several tools to develop
SRCs for a NWM reach.

* **Initial Normal Depth Run.** Discharges ranging from 1.2 times the reach
  high flow threshold to the reach 1% AEP discharge will be incrementally run
  through the reach submodel, and their associated flow depths at each
  cross-section are recorded.  If the source model min flow is lower than 1.2
  times the high flow threshold or the source model max flow is higher than the
  1% AEP discharge, those flow bounds will be used instead

* **Regularized Normal Depth Run.**  After the initial depth-discharge curve
  has been established, ripple1d will attempt to generate a new depth-discharge
  curve at regular depth intervals.  Discharges determined by interpolating a
  regular depth increment along the initial depth-discharge curve will be
  incrementally run through the model, and the new curve will be recorded.

* **Known Water Surface Elevation Run.**  An advantage of HEC-RAS over
  lower-complexity FIM methods is its ability to consider downstream hydraulic
  conditions.  ripple1d pre-processes SRCs for a range of conditions by
  iterating the downstream boundary condition over a range of water surface
  elevations.

Ripple1d generates HEC-RAS inundation depth grids for each of the known water
surface elevation runs.  These grids are cached along with their associated
discharges and downstream conditions so that reach-scale FIM may be retrieved
as soon as a reach forecast is released.
